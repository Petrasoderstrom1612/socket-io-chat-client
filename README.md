# SOCKET-IO-CHAT-CLIENT


Problem statements: 
You've been given the task to write a simple chat client that reads messages from a undocument socket.io server.

Please complete each task before progressing to the next one.


* Task 1: Render incoming chat messages from the socket server in the div.
* Task 2: Some users are colorblind, please create a colorblind option where the username for each chat message is switched from their selected color to a default black instead.
* Task 3: We are always currently displaying the first message received since we joined, for this to be a useful chat we would like to instead automatically automatically scroll to the latest message.
* Task 4: Please create an input field with a button that will send a chat message to the server.
